# Java Screening Test Solutions

This repository contains solutions for 4 Java programming problems that I, **Sneha Vinod Agarwal**, completed for the screening test at TANDEMLOOP TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED. These programs demonstrate my understanding of core Java concepts including classes, methods, loops, conditional statements, and arrays. All programs were implemented using Eclipse IDE.

## Problem 1: Calculator

**Description:**  
I created a simple calculator using a class. The program takes two numbers from the user along with the type of operation to perform. The supported operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

**Implementation Details:**  
- I created a class that stores the two numbers as instance variables.  
- I implemented a method to perform the operation based on the user's input.  
- I added input validation to handle division by zero and invalid operations.  
- This helped me demonstrate my understanding of constructors, instance variables, methods, and `switch` statements in Java.

## Problem 2: Odd Number Sequence

**Description:**  
I wrote a program to print the first `n` odd numbers in sequence, where `n` is provided by the user.  

**Implementation Details:**  
- I used a loop to generate odd numbers dynamically.  
- I calculated each number using a simple formula (`2*i + 1`).  
- The program prints the numbers in a comma-separated format.  
- This problem allowed me to practice loops, arithmetic operations, and formatted output in Java.

## Problem 3: Odd Number Block Sequence

**Description:**  
I implemented a program to generate a specific block of consecutive odd numbers based on a user-provided number.  

**Implementation Details:**  
- I determined the "block" of odd numbers dynamically based on the input.  
- I calculated the total number of odd numbers in the block using a loop.  
- The numbers are printed in a formatted sequence with commas.  
- This exercise helped me strengthen my skills in loops, arithmetic operations, and conditional logic.

## Problem 4: Divisibility Count for Numbers

**Description:**  
I created a program that takes `n` numbers from the user and counts how many of them are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.  

**Implementation Details:**  
- I took input as a comma-separated string and split it into individual numbers.  
- I validated that the correct number of elements is entered.  
- I iterated through each number to check divisibility for numbers 1 through 9.  
- The output displays a structured map showing counts for each divisor.  
- This helped me practice array handling, loops, input parsing, and modular arithmetic in Java.

## How I Ran the Programs in Eclipse

1. I created a new Java Project in Eclipse.  
2. I created a package named `mypackage`.  
3. I added four classes: `Problem1.java`, `Problem2.java`, `Problem3.java`, `Problem4.java`.  
4. I copied my code for each problem into its respective class file.  
5. I ran the classes individually to test and verify the output.
